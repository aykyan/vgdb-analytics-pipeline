ADR 001: Release Date Semantics Are Game-Level, Not Platform-Level

______
STATUS

Accepted

_______
CONTEXT

The VGDB dataset provides a single 'released_date' per game while also
listing multiple platforms per game. When modeling facts at the game x
platform grain, this creates an apparent platform release timeline.

Exploratory analysis revealed historically impossible results (e.g.,
iOS games appearing in the 1980s and 1990s), indicating a semnatic
mismatch rather than a data processing error.

________
DECISION

'eleased_date' is treated as a game-level attribute only.

When joined to platform-level facts, the date represents the game's
initial public release, not the availability date on each platform.

Platform-level temporal analysis must either:
- Apply platform launch-year constraints, or
- Explicitly disclose that dates are game-level only.

____________
CONSEQUENCES

- Platform timelines without correction are analytically misleading
- Corrected analytics models require additional reference data
- Visualizations must document assumptions to prevent misinterpretation
