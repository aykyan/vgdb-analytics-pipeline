ADR 003: Use Polars Instead of Pandas

______
STATUS

Accepted

_______
CONTEXT

The VGDB dataset is approximately 100 MB and contains large array-like
fields requiring explosion and aggregation.

Pandas would require higher memory overhead and less explicit schema
handling for this workload.

________
DECISION

Polars is used as the primary data processing engine.

Key reasons:
- Explicit schemas
- Efficient columnar execution
- Clear distinction between expressions and execution
- Native Parquet support

____________
CONSEQUENCES

- Some APIs differ from Pandas and require learning investment
- Visualization requires conversion to Python-native structures
- The pipeline is more scalable and closer to production data engines
