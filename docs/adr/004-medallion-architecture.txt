ADR 004: Medallion Architecture

______
STATUS

Accepted

_______
CONTEXT

Current project directory is designed with no prior knowledge of data
engineering best practices. It assumed, for example, that \warehouse is a
directory for storing raw data from external sources (in our case, raw csv
datasets). This is wrong.

The accepted definition of a warehouse is that it's for storing final, query-
optimized datasets post-transformation, acting as the project's analytical
output. ETL scripts are directed to load there. This structure also supports
medallion architecture (raw -> refined -> aggregated).

________
DECISION

Restructure the directory to follow the medallion architecture design pattern.

Fix paths in every file.

____________
CONSEQUENCES

- Data logically organized in a lakehouse
- Incrementally and progressively improved structure and quality of data
