ADR 002: The Dataset Avoids AAA / Indie Classification

______
STATUS

Accepted

_______
CONTEXT

The VGDB dataset does not provide reliable indicators of production
budget, studio size, marketing spend, or distribution scale.

Applying AAA or Indie labels would require subjective heuristics or
external enrichment not present in the source data.

________
DECISION

The project does not classify games as "AAA" or "Indie".

Instead, defensible derived signals are used, such as:

- Platform count
- Platform exclusivity
- Presence on major platforms

These signals are explicitly defined and explainable.

____________
CONSEQUENCES

- Analysis avoids subjective or misleading categorization
- Derived metrics remain transparent and reproducible
- Consumers of the data are encouraged to draw informed conclusions
	rather than rely on opaque labels
